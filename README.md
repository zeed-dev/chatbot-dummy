# Chatbot Application

This is a simple chatbot application that provides predefined responses to specific questions about AI technology. The chatbot uses a map of questions and responses to simulate a conversation.

## Bot Responses

The chatbot responds to the following questions with predefined answers:

- **What do you think about AI technology?**  
  Response: "AI technology is revolutionizing various industries, from healthcare to finance!"

- **What’s the most impressive application of AI so far?**  
  Response: "I’d say self-driving cars and natural language processing are at the forefront of AI applications."

- **Can AI replace human jobs?**  
  Response: "AI will automate many tasks, but it will also create new jobs requiring human creativity and problem-solving."

## How to Use

1. **Ask a Question:** Type one of the predefined questions into the chat interface.
2. **Receive a Response:** The chatbot will respond with the corresponding answer from the `botResponses` map.

## Adding More Responses

To add more responses, simply update the `botResponses` map with new questions and answers. For example:

```dart
botResponses["Your Question"] = "Your Response";
```


# Feature-Based Architecture in Flutter
#### Overview

This project utilizes a feature-based architecture, a common approach in Flutter and Dart projects, to enhance scalability, readability, and maintainability. The code is organized into well-defined areas, allowing for efficient development and management as the application grows.

# Folder Structure
#### Core Layer

The **Core Layer** contains reusable modules that are shared across multiple features. This includes:

- **Components**: Common UI components used throughout the app.
- **DI (Dependency Injection)**: Setup for dependency management.
- **Models**: Data structures representing the application's data.
- **Services**: Business logic and services that interact with data sources or APIs.
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities to simplify common tasks.

## Feature Layer

The **Feature Layer** organizes the application by features, each represented in its own directory. For instance, the `chat/` directory includes:

- **Screens**: UI screens specific to the chat feature.
- **Business Logic**: Logic managing the state and functionality of the chat.
- **Services**: Any local services required for the chat feature.

## Benefits of Feature-Based Architecture

1. **Scalability**: New features can be added with minimal disruption to existing code.
2. **Readability**: Code is organized into clear areas, making it easier to navigate.
3. **Modularization**: Each feature can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
